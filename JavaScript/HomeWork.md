### npm install prompt-sync

For practicing JavaScript DSA, the prompt-sync modules are ideal because they allow for simple, synchronous user input handling. This makes it easier to focus on the logic and flow of DSA problems without worrying about the asynchronous nature of standard Node.js input handling.

```
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();

const color = prompt('What is your favorite color? ');
console.log(`Your favorite color is ${color}.`);

```
